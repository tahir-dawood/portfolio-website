                     <h3>UAS Challenge:</h3>
                    IMechE Pakistan has inaugurated its very own competition, the 'UAS Challenge 
                    Pakistan' to give local undergraduate student teams the opportunity to design and
                     manufacture Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).
                    The task for this year's competition was based on a real-life problem of overcoming 
                    the damage done to crops by locusts. The Unmanned Aircraft (UA) would be designed to 
                    be deployed for locust swarm spraying, operating within the Visual Line of Sight.
                     The system was required to operate automatically, performing a series of tasks 
                     including takeoff, navigating waypoints, spraying at infested areas, and returning
                      to base.
