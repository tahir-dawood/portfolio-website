                <p>I am responsible for ensuring that machinery and equipment operate smoothly and 
                    efficiently. I perform regular maintenance and repairs, as well as troubleshooting 
                    when problems arise. In order to be successful in this career, I attended technical 
                    skills courses, training, on-the-job training and certifications which can provide a
                     solid foundation in the field of mechanical maintenance and scheduling.
                    Finally, it is important to stay current with industry trends and developments. 
                    Reading trade publications or attending conferences and seminars can help me stay 
                    abreast of new products, services, and procedures that can improve my job performance.
                     Additionally, networking with other professionals in the field can provide valuable 
                     information about best practices.</p>
