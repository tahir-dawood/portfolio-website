        <div>
                <p> Involvement in Research and Development (R&D) activities that bridge academia and
                     industry is crucial for fostering innovation, advancing technology, and driving 
                     economic growth. Collaboration encourages the training and development of the next 
                     generation of scientists, engineers, and researchers. Students gain hands-on
                      experience and exposure to industry practices. Here's a summary of  my involvement
                       as voluntary general secretary of IMechE Pakistan group in academia under the 
                       flagship event of IMechE.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Abul Kalam Design Challenge</h3>
                    
                    <p>AKDC, based on the Design Challenge being run by IMeche UK, focuses on giving the 
                    freshman engineering students an opportunity to experience a complete product
                     development cycle from the initial design, to the fabrication, testing and product 
                     presentation. The students design a solution for a real-life engineering problem
                      while staying within the constraints given. 
                    The Challenge is run every year with the guidance and advice of Dr. David Ball,
                     Founder Design Challenge UK, who also attended the Finale in person in 2018 in
                      pakistan.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Speak Out for Engineering (SOfE) Presentation Competition</h3>
                    
                    <p>SOfE Pakistan is the part of the global network of SOfE Competitions being 
                    organized by IMechE UK, for YM of the Institution. The competitions seeks to 
                    challenge and groom the verbal and visual communication skills of the participants 
                    in explaining Mechanical Engineering based concepts. SOfE Pakistan starts of with a 
                    Local Heat in each student chapter and Industrial Heats.</p>
